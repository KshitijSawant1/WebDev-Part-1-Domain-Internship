âœ… **Great call!** Starting with a **Node.js introduction** will help students:

* Understand the React + Node.js ecosystem
* Get familiar with JS runtime + tooling (important for using tools like `npm`, `vite`, `create-react-app`, etc.)

* Install Node.js + check version
* NPM vs NPX vs Yarn basics
* Run a simple Node script:

  ```js
  console.log("Hello from Node!");
  ```

### ðŸ›  **Hands-On**

âœ… Build + run a minimal Node.js script
âœ… Create and run a fresh React app
âœ… JS mini challenge: Array of numbers â†’ double values â†’ filter even â†’ sum using `reduce`

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Session Outcome**

> ðŸŒŸ Students will have Node.js installed, understand its role, and create + run a React app starter.

ðŸ’¡ **Shall I update the full syllabus to include this as Session 1 and shift everything else down?**
Do you want me to also **prepare slides / talking points / mini code snippets** for this intro session?
